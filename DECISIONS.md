# Decision log

Local implementation decisions taken while building against
`TREASURE_NAVIGATION_PLAN.md`, in the order they were made. Each entry says
what was decided, why, and whether it deviates from the plan.

Format: `D-nnn — date — title`.

## D-001 — 2026-08-27 — `raw_pointer_delta` carries the held-button context

**Plan text:** §4.2 sketches `raw_pointer_delta(self, dx: int, dy: int) -> None`.

**Decision:** the signature is
`raw_pointer_delta(dx, dy, held_button: MouseButton | None = None)`.

**Why:** §4.4 and bug B8 put the held-state ledger exclusively in
`InputAuthority`, so the port cannot know whether a button is down. But §12's
native yaw note requires the macOS primitive to *hold RMB and emit Quartz delta
drag fields* — a `kCGEventMouseMoved` with delta fields does not turn the
camera while a button is held; a `kCGEventRightMouseDragged` does. The
authority is the only component that knows both facts, so it supplies the
context at call time. Windows ignores the parameter (`MOUSEEVENTF_MOVE`
already delivers a relative delta) and accepts it only for symmetry.

**Deviation:** yes, additive parameter with a default. Reversible.

## D-002 — 2026-08-27 — `IntentType.PIXEL_INFO` added

**Plan text:** §3.2 lists eight intent types; F3 pixel info is not among them.

**Decision:** added a ninth, `PIXEL_INFO`, bound to F3 on both platforms.

**Why:** F3 is the existing, working calibration read-out, and §4.1 requires
the legacy pixels to be *re-derived* against the canonical client basis — which
is exactly what F3 is for. Routing it through the coordinator like everything
else is better than giving the hotkey listener a private side channel. It
reads one already-captured frame and shows a value; it is never given an input
session, does not change `RunMode`, and does not consume or disturb an arm
token.

**Deviation:** yes, additive. Reversible.

---

## D-003 — 2026-08-27 — `cursor_client_px()` added to `PlatformPort`

**Decision:** the port exposes a read-only cursor position in client-relative
physical pixels.

**Why:** both `--calibrate` and the F3 probe need it, and doing the
screen→client conversion inside the port is what keeps desktop coordinates out
of feature code (§4.3). It returns `None` rather than a coordinate when the
client rect is unverified or the cursor is outside it, so a wrong number can
never be pasted into a config file.

**Deviation:** additive, read-only, emits nothing.

---

## D-004 — 2026-08-27 — Python floor is 3.13, not a wider claimed range

**Decision:** `requires-python = ">=3.13"`.

**Why:** §17 forbids declaring a support range before verifying it. CPython
3.13.15 (macOS arm64, Tk 9.0) is the only interpreter this suite has been
executed on, and the numpy 2.5 stubs the project type-checks against already
require 3.12+. Widening to 3.11/3.12 is PENDING an actual run there.

---

## D-005 — 2026-08-27 — macOS title-bar inset is measured, not assumed

**Decision:** `MacPlatformPort` derives the client rect from the AX window
frame minus a title-bar height computed as
`2 * (close_button_y - frame_y) + close_button_height`, falling back to a
documented 28.0 pt constant only when Accessibility cannot see the traffic
lights. The port reports which of the two was used.

**Why:** §4.1 requires a *verified* client rect, and macOS only offers the
outer frame. Reading the window's own button geometry turns the inset into a
measurement instead of a guess. Observed on the development Mac on 2026-08-27
against the running Roblox client: frame origin y = 39.0 pt, close button at
y = 46.0 pt with height 14.0 pt, giving exactly 28.0 pt, and a resulting client
rect of `origin=(0, 134) px, size=(3600, 2108) px, scale=2.0`. That is one
machine and one window state; E-VIEW on macOS is still PENDING.

---

## D-006 — 2026-08-27 — Legacy pixels are carried over unchanged and marked PENDING

**Decision:** `TreasurePixels` ships the legacy dig/pan/reset coordinates
byte-for-byte with `EvidenceStatus.PENDING`, plus a
`from_legacy_window_frame(title_bar_px)` transform that is *offered but not
applied by default*.

**Why:** §4.1 says the legacy pixels must be transformed to client coordinates
and manually reverified, and that the old numbers must not be silently reused.
Two things changed at once: the origin moved (frame → client) *and* the pinned
area got bigger (a 1280×720 frame contained a 1280×664 client; the canonical
pin makes the client itself 1280×720). A mechanical y-shift fixes the first but
not the second, so applying it automatically would replace one wrong number
with a differently wrong number that looks migrated. Instead the values stay as
the ones that demonstrably worked, the status is loudly PENDING in the UI, the
self-test, and the profile card, and `--calibrate` reports in the canonical
basis so re-deriving them is a five-minute job for the owner.

---

## D-007 — 2026-08-27 — Characterization baseline is a recorded transcript

**Decision:** `tests/fixtures/legacy_sequences.json` holds the ordered input
transcript of the pre-navigator dig, dequip, pan-swap, and reset sequences,
captured from commit `5b81120` with every OS edge and every sleep intercepted.
`tests/test_characterization.py` asserts the new bounded services reproduce it.

**Why:** §15 Phase 0A wants correct current behavior preserved without
preserving B1–B13. A recorded transcript is the only form of that evidence that
survives deleting the legacy module. Screen sampling is excluded from the
comparison because the new services read one coherent frame instead of grabbing
per pixel — that difference *is* the B12 fix.

---

## D-008 — 2026-08-27 — Shadow gets a real authority generation with input disabled

**Decision:** Shadow activates an authority generation with
`emits_input=False`, so admission never opens, rather than not activating one
at all.

**Why:** it keeps one code path for generation bookkeeping and evidence
registration while making a press structurally impossible: `NoInputSession`
holds no reference to the authority, and even if it did, admission is closed.
Two independent barriers rather than one.

---

## D-009 — 2026-08-27 — Windows port is written but not executed

**Decision:** `platform_win.py` is complete, annotated, and type-checked, but
carries a module-level notice that nothing in it has run on Windows.

**Why:** §18.8 forbids claiming Windows behavior from a Mac. mypy on macOS
cannot resolve `ctypes.windll`, so `pyproject.toml` exempts exactly those two
Win32-only names for that module and says why. The opposite-OS import test
covers structure only; every Windows row in §16.3 stays `pending`.
